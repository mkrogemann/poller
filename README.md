poller is a Ruby gem that supports testing asynchronous calls to systems under test by exposing Poller implementations.

It is in large parts inspired by the work of Steeve Freeman &amp; Nat Pryce and their excellent GOOS book ("Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests").

Installation
------------
The gem can be installed in the usual ways. Either let bundler take care of it and add to your Gemfile like this:

    gem 'poller'

Or install it directly on your command line

    gem install poller

Usage
-----
TBD

Scope &amp; Feature Requests
----------------------------
In its current implementation stage, the gem focuses on systems that are accessible via http calls.

Please contact me in case you have ideas/feature requests both in terms of http-based systems and extensions for non http-based systems.

Pull requests and bug reports are welcome!
